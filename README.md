# OpenSDM (Open SmartDevice Manager)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/0x0verflow/OpenSDM.svg?token=HBATqM2wqsqcLjWHoAcb&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/0x0verflow/OpenSDM)

An open-sourced SmartDevice manager for a selfbuilt smarthome using ESP8266 or Arduinos

## Introduction
OpenSDM is an open-sourced manager for "SmartDevices". These SmartDevices can be built out of Arduinos or ESP8266. OpenSDM itself runs on a Raspberry PI. A cheap setup with 2 SmartDevices wouldn't cost more than 40â‚¬.

## Contributing
OpenSDM is depending on contributers. I would be really happy if you could implement one of the TODOs.

## TODOs for contributers
- Webinterface
  - Tabs:
    - Home: Device overview, time, weather...
    - Devices: List of all devices with controls
    - Settings: Settings... just settings...
  - Webinterface should be completely written in client-sided JavaScript. OpenSDM will host the endpoints.
- Better config system (?)
- Anything you want...
